        <article class="content">
            <p>
                Fast steps pierce through the rough stone pavement. A woman fully clothed in black. Ignoring the extravagant carriages by the Henderson blacksmithery, the black shadow hushed toward the glorious castle gate. There was a noble struggling through paperwork, delaying the gate soldiers. The woman in black, nervous and somewhat agitated, walks up to one of the soldiers and asks how much longer it will take. The soldier, clearly annoyed, rolls his eyes and tells her to get back in line. 
			</p>
            
            <p style="margin-left: 10%; font-style: italic;">
                “I need to get in now!” The woman shouts to the soldier, “You will regret this if you do not let me in!”
			</p>

            <p>
                The soldier grunts and points his spear at the strange woman, signaling her to back off. The woman answers while pulling out a strange contraption from her coat. And in a heartbeat, a hole in the soldier's head. Only a flash of light, followed by a loud, devastating sound. Not even the wall behind was unscathed. The other gate soldiers flinched and couldn’t believe what had happened, as a few seconds later, the mysterious woman was already gone. Inside the castle walls of the Holy Empire, the king awaits. Entertained by a jester while talking to some other nobles from the nearby Flacon Dynasty. An informant rushes in. 
			</p>
			
			<p style="margin-left: 10%; font-style: italic;">
                “My liege, I crave thy gracious pardon for this intrusion, even thy meeting with the esteemed guests from the Flacon Dynasty.” The informant said while bowing his head, “Yet, a matter of grave misfortune hath transpired at the main gate.” <br><br>
				The king replied, “Thou surely knowest the punishment for uselessly disturbing such an important occasion.” <br><br>
				“Yes, yes.” The informant stuttered, “My King. The gate soldiers reportedly said Black Magic was used to infiltrate the Empire. Even one soldier was killed.” <br><br>
				The king rubs his eyebrows. “Black magic, sayest thou? I thought the holy army hath killed all of them…”
			</p>
			
			<p>
                Without a moment to process, screams could be heard from the other side of the banquet door. The strongest men of the king's army positioned themselves between the king and the entrance, waiting for the moment this unknown enemy steps afoot in the banquet room. <br><br>
				The room was filled with silence. Everyone was awaiting a response from the other side of the door. The pressure was sickening until a wooden screech flooded the room. Two of the king's men instantly thrust their spears through the gap, piercing the body on the other side. But instead of a relief, a shock paralyzed their bodies, only leaving their mouths open in confusion, stuttering the name of their fallen comrade.
			</p>
			
			<p style="margin-left: 10%; font-style: italic;">
                “E-Edward?”
			</p>
			
			<p>
				It was no stranger, but their own man. Falling to his knees after two devastating blows to his chest. Right after, the room erupted in a devastating white light, drilling a hole through both soldiers' heads. There was no chance of survival. As both of the soldiers' bodies crumble to the ground, the mysterious figure in black gazes at the king with a distasteful smile and spouts her finalizing words.
        	</p>
			
			<p style="margin-left: 10%; font-style: italic;">
                “Finally!”
			</p>
			
			<p>
				With no remorse, she points the contraption against the king and presses the trigger. The king, seeing this bright and beautiful color, sat frozen. A feeling of regret and the thought of punishment overflow his body. Maybe it was fate by the gods to end it all? But before this destined light could hit him. It changed to a familiar shape. Similar to some of the cards he played with in his childhood. It was a spade. <br><br>
				The weird smile of the woman drops. Her skin began to feel hot. Even though her throat was dry like a desert. Her clothes were as wet as the depths of the ocean. Nervously, she presses a button deep in her cloak's pocket. But to no avail, since nothing happens. She tries to run away. Only to be blocked by an invisible wall. Until a smooth and slightly deep voice appears. 
        	</p>
			
			<p style="margin-left: 10%; font-style: italic;">
                “By the laws of the time protocol 3§2f, I, prosecutor Agent Spade. Will arrest you for manipulating the past and attempted murder of a prominent figure.” 
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Leaving no other possibility, the woman quickly shoves the gun into her mouth, frantically hammering the trigger. The gun is meanwhile useless, without as much as the clicking of the embedded spring.
			</p>
			
			<p style="margin-left: 10%; font-style: italic;">
                “Please don't make it harder than it is.”  
			</p>
			
			<p>
				He approaches the woman, taking slow and loud steps. Taking the previously used card in front of the king. Not even a scratch had the card suffered to block the shot. Spade smiled shortly at the still shocked king before turning back to the fugitive. 
			</p>
			
			<p style="margin-left: 10%; font-style: italic;">
                “It was annoying as it is to track you down in the previous two timelines.” The agent stands before the woman and uses a small machine to restrain her movement. “Now, if you would excuse us.” 
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Adding those last words and a small bow before the spectators. Leaving nothing behind. The two disappear into an endless crack of infinity. <br><br>
				Later, where time is just a number.
			</p>
			
			<p style="margin-left: 10%; font-style: italic;">
                “Hey Spade! Heard you finally caught that perpetrator?” a soft voice named Amanda asks. <br><br>
				“Yeah. She was pretty fast on her feet. Now I know why James needed help. Any news from Charles?” Spade continues. <br><br>
				“Heard he will retire after the incident. Nearly losing his limbs took a big toll on his mental state, he said.” <br><br>
				“Can imagine that. Being a time agent isn’t everyone's cup of tea.” <br><br>
				“Also. Chief said, You’ll be needed later for the interrogation.” Amanda spins her pen. “You know her, Spade. She is pretty stressed out lately. So don't be late. Ok?” <br><br>
				“Alright. I’ll see what I can do. Tell her I'll be right on my way.” 
			</p>
			
			<p>
				As Spade walks down the hallway, he stops shortly before the images on both sides. Some portraits of previous chiefs and important members. Some historical or special locations. Or even impactful events. It could be considered a collection of important cases. But for most agents it was more of a far memory. While for Spade it was a chunk of his past. <br><br>
				As a time agent, it was important to accept certain things. First, the mortality of man. Though time may be irrelevant for such an agent. One is still mortal. And once a member leaves the field, even time can’t bring them back. Secondly, one only preserves history and does not change it. But this wasn’t Spade's reason for joining in the past. He only joined to arrest the criminals, not to correct the past. That's why he chose the Task Force and not the Preservers. <br><br>
				One of those faces on the wall standing right next to the current agency leader was Spade. He had been here for quite a long time with the present agency head. Even though he was asked to take over multiple times, he disagreed. Being appointed would only mean less freedom and more office work. <br><br>
				Some meters further ahead, the elevator was located. Selecting the 3rd floor, he waits while tapping his feet to the background music. Over a vibrating peeping sound, the heavy door opens to a long hallway of named doors. A few steps to the left, his name was framed in an antique piece of wooden chinaware. Showing his card, he closes the distance to a small box next to the door. <br><br>
				With his eyes open, staring deep into the wooden box, and a small peeping sound later, he gently opens his room. Containing plenty of old relics, some framed pictures, and lastly, a bit of furnishing. Everything was decorated to fill the greenish empty space created. Illuminated by a window to an ancient ruin bathed in a digital sunset, with a tropical ambient soundtrack playing, one could even consider it a dormant home. He places a small ornament, bearing a sigil of the Holy Empire, on top of a drawer. After a proud gaze upon his collection, he steps back in the elevator and switches to the first floor. At which a familiar but stressed face welcomes Spade’s arrival via a short sigh.
			</p>
			
			<p style="margin-left: 10%; font-style: italic;">
                “Morning, Chief.” As Spade greets her, he steps out and walks alongside the sleep-deprived woman. “Got any time for some coffee before the interrogation?” <br><br>
				“Spare me with your nonchalant tone. I couldn’t get a wink in weeks.” <br><br>
				“So, is that a yes?” Spade presses.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				After another long, annoyed sigh, the chief taps Spade’s shoulder with a ravenous smile.
			</p>
			
			<p style="margin-left: 10%; font-style: italic;">
                “But you are paying.” <br><br>
				“Alright, alright.”
			</p>
			
			<p>
				The two reach a small but comfy waiting area. Normally used for subjects right before the interrogation. It included some seats, a bit of furnishing, and cups. As well as a water dispenser and a vending and coffee machine. With a single swipe of Spade’s card, the machine seemed to have awoken from its eternal slumber. 
			</p>
			
			<p style="margin-left: 10%; font-style: italic;">
                “Americano or black?” <br><br>
				“Let's go with black.”
			</p>
			
			<p>
				The machine spouts in action. Creating a thick and strong-smelling aromatic and shortly after filling the two cups placed under. The chief takes one and balances it with her other hand on the table. 
			</p>
			
			<p style="margin-left: 10%; font-style: italic;">
                “So, how was your trip? Did you enjoy going sightseeing?” 
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Spade takes the other cup, mixing in some sugar and swirling it around until he answers.
			</p>
			
			<p style="margin-left: 10%; font-style: italic;">
                “Less than I would like to have. This case subject was a pain in the ass. If I hadn't given her some distance in the end. I’m sure I would still be on her trail.” <br><br>
				“Seems like you had a tough time. How surprising.” The Chief followed with a great vitalizing sip. “I have already grasped some details from the others and read through some recordings. But what's your take on this case?” <br><br>
				With both legs crossed, Spade leans against the wall. “I’m not quite sure either. She could be just one of those kingslayers, being a fanatic about killing previous leaders. Or just have an entirely other motive. But it’s still weird. Ever since I was set up on this case. I haven’t been able to confirm any of the previously stated identifications about her.” <br><br>
				The chief fixes her eyes firmly on the rotating brew in her hand. “Can you elaborate further?” <br><br>
				“Visually, she is clearly the subject we are searching for. But on paper, it felt like a different person.” <br><br>
				“Could it have been a wrong testimony or a sudden shift in motivation?” <br><br>
				“Not sure. Maybe. Either way, because of that, she was more trouble than anticipated.” <br><br>
				“I see.” 
			</p>
			
			<p>
				The chief drinks the rest of her black coffee in a single swoop and places it down onto the designated area. Right after, she signals Spade to follow her into interrogation room 1B. Spade responds with a slight lift of his cup before he follows. 
			</p>
			
			<p style="margin-left: 10%; font-style: italic;">
                “If you don’t mind.” <br><br>
				“Whatever is to your liking.” 
			</p>
			
			<p>
				The interrogation room. A bland, grayish wall with three chairs and a table. The woman in black attire is already waiting, chained to the heavy chair. Once Spade entered the room, it took only a few seconds for the woman to nervously try freeing her hands. 
			</p>
			
			<p style="margin-left: 10%; font-style: italic;">
                With a slight smirk, the chief looks to Spade. “Seems like you’re still quite popular with those youngsters.” <br><br>
				“You think so?”
			</p>
			
			<p>
				She sits down on one of the plastic-coated chairs, smiling at the captive. 
			</p>
			
			<p style="margin-left: 10%; font-style: italic;">
                “Good evening. How should we address you? Miss Caroline, Shiva, or Sarah?” 
			</p>
			
			<p>
				The captive, still struggling, watches as Spade slowly descends to the table. The chief follows. 
			</p>
			
			<p style="margin-left: 10%; font-style: italic;">
                “We don’t want to hurt you. On the contrary. The kingslayers are renowned for being quite manipulative. Please help us and set things straight.” 
			</p>
			
			<p>
				After a prolonged moment of silence and disinterest of the captive.  
			</p>
			
			<p style="margin-left: 10%; font-style: italic;">
                “Did this ever work on any of those psychopaths?”
			</p>
			
			<p>
				After those words, the chief threw a sharp, painstaking glance over to Spade, who innocently took another sip from his mug. Signaling him to choose his next words wisely.
			</p>
			
			<p style="margin-left: 10%; font-style: italic;">
                “Sorry. You never heard a thing. Just continue with your procedure.” <br><br>
				In the next moment she took Spades’ cup and drank the remainder before uttering, “Alright, you won. I’ll link myself up. Take care of my body.”
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Still leaving Spade somewhat chastened about his cup, her eyes begin to light up after a heavy blink. Multiple holographic shapes, as if a gate to her soul had opened. Fixated on the captive, while the chief’s body stiffens, the woman in black panics more than ever. But as if the captive had predicted the course of action, she tries to shoot a sharp needle from her mouth onto the still motionless body. But at no avail, it only took Spade a swift motion with the cup to block the flying needle. Right after, the perpetrator surrenders face first to the table, completing the first step of the procedure. After another few seconds, the link was already completed. But there was no relief on her face, only unease.  
			</p>
			
			<p style="margin-left: 10%; font-style: italic;">
                “What did you find?” <br><br>
				She takes an exhausted breath. “Something I would rather not have. Let's go back.” 
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Outside the interrogation room, the used cup was already gone. With a brief frown, the chief looks around. Calculating her next move, she walks into one of the empty interrogation rooms, dragging Spade with her. 
			</p>
			
			<p style="margin-left: 10%; font-style: italic;">
                “Seems like you found something quite important.” <br><br>
				She continues as she plumps down into one of the chairs. “There is an informant inside their circle.” <br><br>
				“Did you find out their identity?” <br><br>
				“I have not, but that’s not the point. He knew about our plans, and that you would take over.” <br><br>
				“Wasn’t this only a week ago?” <br><br>
				“There is more. It seems like you were right about the sudden shift in tactics. Unfortunately, I couldn’t access the deeper memories. But it seems the informant is in contact with each of the big shots. It was only by accident that she found out, and right after started to panic.” <br><br>
				Somewhat shaken, Spade leans against the wall, gathering his thoughts. “What's the chance of a bug being planted?” <br><br>
				“Possible but low. They would need to create a communication device through time itself or at least recover the bug to collect information.” <br><br>
				Pushing himself from the wall, he walks around the small room. “Did we lose any agents in the last week?” <br><br>
				“Can’t think of any reports regarding missing or dead agents.” 
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Both, seemingly distressed, try to think of a plausible solution to the problem. But every other thought leads further from the goal.
			</p>
			
			<p style="margin-left: 10%; font-style: italic;">
                With both hands on the table. The chief steps up in front of Spade. “I will look through the latest reports. Maybe I can find something useful. As for you, could I ask you to look around for anything suspicious?” 
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Spade, knowing the current situation. He abruptly changes his demeanor and answers with a silent nod before leaving the room.
			</p>
			
			<p style="margin-left: 10%; font-style: italic;">
                “And Spade. Please don’t disappoint me.” 
			</p>
			
			<p>
				He didn’t know where to start and first walked down to the cafeteria. But the groups didn’t encounter anything unusual. It still could only be a facade, but he had no time to collect sufficient data. Him being back with the too-informed subject could have already alerted the traitor. Yet thinking about it, this might also be a clue. On the one hand, if the traitor still doesn’t know. It might be hard to distinguish any unusual behaviors. But on the other hand, if the traitor did know about it. 
			</p>
			
			<p style="margin-left: 10%; font-style: italic;">
                “Hey Amanda, could you help me out for a second?” <br><br>
				“Sure, what’s the problem?” <br><br>
				“Just wanted to ask about any sudden leaves. Chief’s a bit stressed out. So I thought about helping her with the team scheduling.” <br><br>
				“Ah, I’m glad. Please wait a second. Let me look through the protocol. So, preserve teams D and F are currently out, as well as-” <br><br>
				Spade interrupts. “Anyone without a group?” <br><br>
				“Without a group? Well, there is one. Charles said he wanted to walk around the agency. Something about decreasing stress-” <br><br>
				“How long was that?” <br><br>
				“You are quite feisty today… But now that you mention it. It was right after you arrived.” <br><br>
				“Alright, thanks. I will go look for him.” 
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Running around the park area encircling the building, he was able to see multiple things. The fake sky, plants, trees, and birds. But not Charles. The building wasn’t that broad. If Spade tried, he could finish around in a few minutes. But there was still no trace of Charles. After returning to the building, he rushes towards the elevators on the 3rd floor. But differently than before, he finds the chief waiting before Charles's looked room.
			</p>
			
			<p style="margin-left: 10%; font-style: italic;">
                “Wondered when you might show up. Already tried unlocking with my access card. Still won't budge.” 
			</p>
			
			<p>
				The piercing red display next to the door uncontrollably repeats its blocking message. 
			</p>
			
			<p style="margin-left: 10%; font-style: italic;">
                Without a second thought, Spade pulls out a small gun and a round device from his holster. “Can you please stand aside for a second?” <br><br>
				“Be my guest.”
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Sticking the device to the door, he takes a few steps back and shortly glances over to the chief. After her approving nod, the device springs into action. Flashing in extreme heat and disintegrating the door as well as everything a meter behind. The smoke cleared, revealing not a messy room, but a void. <br><br>
				The apartment was stripped. Not just of furniture, but of presence. The indentations in the carpet where a bed should have been were gone. The hooks on the walls held no shadows of frames. It wasn't that Charles had moved out. It was as if he had never lived there at all. <br><br>
				Spade stepped into the center of the wide hollow room. Lowering his gun, he could only watch in disbelief as memories of Charles began to twist. Who was Charles? Were their years of partnership merely a fabricated script? He tried to picture his friend's face, but the features were pixelating, dissolving into the gray mist of nonexistence. <br><br>
				The red display next to the door flickered one last time, then flatlined.
